Step-by-step guide on how to create this Personal Expense Tracker project using MySQL, Python (with Flask), and HTML/CSS/JavaScript:

Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment**

    1. Install Python: You can download it from the official Python website.

    2. Install MySQL: You can download it from the official MySQL website. During installation, note down the username and password you set for the MySQL server as you'll need them later.

    3. Install Visual Studio Code: You can download it from the official Visual Studio Code website.

    4. Install Git: You can download it from the official Git website.

Step 2: Create Your Project Directory

    1. Create a new directory for your project on your computer.

    2. Open Visual Studio Code and open the directory you just created.

Step 3: Set Up Your Python Environment

    1. Create a new virtual environment for Python in your project directory. This will help to keep your project's dependencies isolated from other Python projects on your computer.

    2. Activate the virtual environment.

    3. Install Flask and the MySQL Connector/Python library in your virtual environment.

Step 4: Design Your Database

    1. Plan out the structure of your expenses table. It should have columns for the expense ID, date, amount, and description.

Step 5: Create Your Database and Table

    1. Open the MySQL command-line client or a MySQL GUI like MySQL Workbench.

    2. Log in with the username and password you set during installation.

    3. Create a new database for your project.

    4. In your new database, create the expenses table with the structure you planned in the previous step.

Step 6: Write Your Backend Code

    1. In your project directory, create a new Python file.

    2. In this file, set up a new Flask application.

    3. Connect to your MySQL database using the MySQL Connector/Python library.

    4. Write routes for your Flask application to handle creating, reading, updating, and deleting expenses. These routes should interact with your database to perform the appropriate operations.

Step 7: Create Your Frontend

    1. In your project directory, create new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

    2. In your HTML file, create a form for adding new expenses and a table for displaying existing expenses.

    3. In your CSS file, add styles to make your page look nice.

    4. In your JavaScript file, write code to send requests to your Flask routes when the form is submitted and to update the table when the page loads.

Step 8: Test Your Application

    1. Start your Flask application.

    2. Open your HTML file in a web browser.

    3. Try adding, viewing, updating, and deleting expenses to make sure everything works as expected.
